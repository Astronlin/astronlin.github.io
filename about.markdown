Hello, I am Lingrui Lin.

I am now a Ph.D student in the School of Astronomy and Space Science at Nanjing
University. I work on the kinematic and dynamics of the interstellar medium,
ranging from molecular clouds in the Milky Way to the rotating disks of
high-redshift galaxies.

I am also the teaching assistant of the ISM lecture of the 2024 Spring
semester.
