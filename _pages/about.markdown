Hello, I am Lingrui Lin.

I am now a Ph.D student in the School of Astronomy and Space Science at Nanjing
University. I work on the kinematic and dynamics of the interstellar medium,
ranging from molecular clouds in the Milky Way to the rotating disks of
high-redshift galaxies.

I was born in Ganyu, Lianyungang city, Jiangsu province, China. It is a town
near the sea so I went to the seaside very often when I was at my hometown. 

For information on my education, research, responsibilities, etc., please refer to my CV below.
